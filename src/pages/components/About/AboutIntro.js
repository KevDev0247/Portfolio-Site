                    I have a strong interest in software engineering with experiences in clinical research, finance, and manufacturing sectors. 
                    In the future, I plan to specialize in machine learning or AI to extend their unparalleled power into different industries.
                    <br/><br/>
                    As a software engineer by trade, I have extensive knowledge of full stack web engineering with experiences in multiple tech stack.
                    I can work on 3 backend tech stacks --- MERN stack, Java with Springboot, and C# with ASP.NET. For frontend, I can do both 
                    Typescript and JavaScript with Angular, React, or traditional AJAX style frontend. Android development is another specialty of mine. 
                    In addition to the tech stacks, I also have a firm understanding in design patterns, architecture, and fundamental algorithms as well as data structures.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Currently, I am learning about machine learning and data engineering, which can be the flesh and bones of any software system. 
                    I have elementary understanding of BI concepts including data warehouse, data lake, data mart, and the relevant architectures.
